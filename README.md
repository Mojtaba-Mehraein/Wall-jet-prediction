# Wall-jet-prediction
In this project we try to predict the wall jet velocity using hybrid CatBoost models. The parameters such as expansion ratio, tailwater depth ratio, Reynolds number, jet thickness, longitudinal and vertical distances from the solid boundaries are the effective parameters on non-dimensional form of the jet velocity.
