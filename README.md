This study aims to predict non-dimensional wall jet velocity using a suite of hybrid machine learning models based on CatBoost. The input data is structured in a CSV file, where the features—longitudinal distance (X), vertical distance (Y), tailwater depth ratio (TWR), expansion ratio (ER), and Reynolds number (Re)—are loaded in the first five columns, with the sixth column containing the label, non-dimensional velocity (U).

The predictive models consider these effective parameters to forecast the jet velocity. The core methodology involves benchmarking a standalone CatBoost model against hybrid versions that integrate the CatBoost algorithm with four distinct optimization techniques: the Coati Optimization Algorithm, Gray Wolf Optimization Algorithm, Whale Optimization Algorithm, and Bayesian Optimization. The output for each implemented model is a structured file containing two sheets: one for the model's predicted velocities and another for the corresponding measured values.
