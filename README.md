# Wall-jet-prediction
In this project, we try to predict the wall jet velocity using hybrid CatBoost models. The parameters such as expansion ratio, tailwater depth ratio, Reynolds number, jet thickness, and longitudinal and vertical distances from the solid boundaries are the effective parameters on the non-dimensional form of the jet velocity. The models are standalone CatBoost and the hybrid CatBoost Models. The Optimization algorithms are Coati Optimization Algorithm, Gray Wolf Optimization Algorithm, Whale Optimization Algorithm, and Bayesian Optimization Algorithm. The output file of each code is the prediction values and the measured values of the velocities in two sheets.
